Hello! I’m Vincent, part of the CCAZ team for our CSCI1000 GitHub project.  
I’m learning how to use GitHub collaboratively and understand merge conflicts, commits, and markdown formatting.

## Key Takeaways
- Collaboration builds both communication and coding confidence.  
- Merge conflicts help us learn problem-solving under pressure.  
- Working together makes version control much more intuitive.

## Fun Fact
I enjoy coding, snowboarding, and exploring new AI tools to improve efficiency.
